  <h2>What We Wish To Achieve with M.O.M</h2>
  <p style="font-size:100%;">We want to break down our users and build them up to be stronger mentally. So, we decided to make things beneficial for them and be mindful of the lives that they may have. There are other websites that serve the same purpose as ours, but the time to serve can be short. We want our services to be long term, which is why we want to give our users the abilities to both create their own  accounts and personal journals (notes) for as long as can be. If you ever choose to take advantage of our opportunities to you, then we will make sure that you do not regret it. We want our users to see this website as a new beginning to a journey that they can positively impact them for the rest of their lives. We would like our users to create their accounts, attend their sessions, take notes of their experiences, reflect on their decisions in the past, and thank us for providing a gateway to a potentially better future.</p>
